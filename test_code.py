    #we were unable to provide good unit tests because all of our functions
    #were either pulling data or graphing data from a csv. We attempted
    #numerous times and consulted many people and we had no luck in our
    #search for a good test without needing to recode essential parts of our
    #project. Additionally, the tests we were able to find were redundant
    #in the eyes of pylint and ourselves. We apologize for the lack of
    #tests.
